# Olly G's Game Deals

A Gatsby/React app with a Firebase backend so Olly G can give us the all juicy game deals.

Stuff we're using:
- https://www.gatsbyjs.org/
- https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-firebase/
- https://github.com/CSFrequency/react-firebase-hooks
- https://react-bootstrap.github.io/

## Development
Make sure you have the latest versions of Node and Yarn. Install Gatsby CLI with `npm install -g gatsby-cli`. Install dependencies with `yarn install`. Run `gatsby develop` to get going! Whenever a push/PR into master happens, a GitHub Action will inject our environment variables, run `gatsby build`, and push the site to gh-pages.
