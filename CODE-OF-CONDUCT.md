# Code Of Conduct
TLDR: Be a good person.

This is not a comprehensive document which outlines everything you shouldn't 
do. Instead it provides a series of goals which we hope everyone's behavior will meet.

- Be open to people of all types and backgrounds
- Be respectful to all, personal attacks will not be tolerated
- No explicit language or slurs in the source code or issue tracker
